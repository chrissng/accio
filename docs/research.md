Accio is a research project developed by the [DRIM team](https://liris.cnrs.fr/drim/) of the [LIRIS laboratory](https://liris.cnrs.fr), within the [Priva'Mov project](https://privamov.liris.cnrs.fr).
It is named after the spell *Accio* in the Harry Potter books, whose goal is to make a remote object fly towards the spell caster.
