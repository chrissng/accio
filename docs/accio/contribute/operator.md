title: Implementing a custom operator

Operators are the basic building block of workflows.
Accio comes with some built-in operators, but you may need to implement new ones.
Opeators need to be implemented directly in Scala, though this may evolve in the future.

## 1. Create a new operator class

As of now, all operators are implemented inside the `src/jvm/fr/cnrs/liris/privamov/ops` module.
You may decide to create a new module for a new operator or new family of operators, or stick inside this module.
The first step is to decide a name for your operator and create a new class for its implementation.
By convention, all operators' names finish with the "Op" suffix (that is later automatically removed from its actual name).

You may need to add some dependencies to the `BUILD` file if you wish to add new libraries.
The following Accio-related dependencies must be included in any module containing operator implementations:

  * `src/jvm/fr/cnrs/liris/accio/core/api` contains interfaces and standard data types
  * `src/jvm/fr/cnrs/liris/accio/core/api:annotations` contains Java annotations.

## 2. Implement the operator class

Then, you will need to implement the `Operator[In,Out]` interface, which mainly defines an `execute(In, OpContext)` methods.

```scala
import fr.cnrs.liris.accio.core.api._

@Op(
  category = "useless",
  help = "An operator that does absolutely nothing")
class TotallyUselessOp extends Operator[Unit, Unit] {
  override def execute(in: Unit, ctx: OpContext): Unit = {
    println("My operator is running and doing nothing")
  }
}
```

This is an operator that simply prints something to the standard output but does actually nothing.
Still a few things are worth noting.

  * Operators must be annotated with an `@Op` annotation.
  Whereas all arguments are optional, it is very useful to provide information to the end-user about what this operator does.
  By default, the operator name is the simple name of the class (i.e., without the namespace), with the "Op" suffix stripped.
  You may override this by explicitly specifying a `name` argument.
  * This operator has no input and no output, indicated with the `Unit` type argument (first is for input, second for output).

**The execution of any operator must be deterministic and reproducible.**
In other words, given some inputs, it should always produce the exact same outputs.
It means the implementation must not use any source of external randomness such as `scala.util.Random` or current system time.

## 3. Define the inputs and outputs

Because an operator without any input or output is not exactly very useful, we will see how to define that.
This is a contract for the operator, whose implementation is basically just responsible for converting inputs (received as first argument of the `execute` method) into outputs (the return value of the `execute` method).
This means that an operator implementation can be used very easily outside of the context of Accio.

Inputs and outputs are defined with Scala case classes, each constructor argument becoming an input/output argument for the operator.
By convention the input class is named after the operator suffixed with "In" (instead of "Op") and the output class is named after the operator suffixed with "Out" (instead of "Op").

```scala
import fr.cnrs.liris.accio.core.api._

@Op(
  category = "numeric",
  help = "An operator that multiplies a number by another one")
class MultiplyOp extends Operator[MultiplyIn, MultiplyOut] {
  override def execute(in: MultiplyIn, ctx: OpContext): MultiplyOut = {
    MultiplyOut(in.a * in.b)
  }
}

case class MultiplyIn(@Arg a: Int, @Arg b: Int)

case class MultiplyOut(@Arg c: Int)
```

This operator has two integer input ports, `a` and `b` that will get multiplied together to fill a single integer port, `c`.
A bunch of new things are worth noting.

  * Input and output arguments must be annotated with an `@Arg` annotation.
  * All arguments of the input class must be mapped to ports, whereas some arguments of the output class may be left apart.
  In this case you will not annotate them with `@Arg` and they will be ignored by Accio.
  * Input and output arguments must be of one of the authorized data types in Accio.
  It is enforced at runtime.
  Additionally, input arguments may be of an optional type of a valid data type.
  This allows the operator to executed even if no value is specified for this port.
  Output arguments must always be specified.

## 4. Register your operator

All operators are registered in the `fr.cnrs.liris.privamov.ops.OpsModule` class, through the [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) framework.
Operators are registered by their class name (not an instance of them).
You simply need to add a new line to register your operator.

```scala
import com.google.inject.TypeLiteral
import fr.cnrs.liris.accio.core.api.Operator
import net.codingwell.scalaguice.{ScalaModule, ScalaMultibinder}

object OpsModule extends ScalaModule {
  override def configure(): Unit = {
    val ops = ScalaMultibinder.newSetBinder(binder, new TypeLiteral[Class[_ <: Operator[_, _]]] {})
    // Many other operators registrations.
    // Here goes our new operator.
    ops.addBinding.toInstance(classOf[MultiplyOp])
  }
}
```

## Cookbook

We have only scratched the surface of what operators can do.
We provide here some recipes for more advanced use cases.

### Using external dependencies

Your operators may have dependencies to other objects.
For that purpose, we provide integration with the [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) dependency injection framework.
All operators are created using a Guice injector, which mean you can use usual `@Inject` (and other) annotations to have your dependencies automatically injected.
You may also need to modify the `OpsModule` Guice module to wire any new interface to its implementation.

### Documenting your operators

Operator and port annotations come with various options useful to document them.
It can even be used to automatically generate a documentation ready to be integrated on a web site.
You can learn more about this topic on the [dedicated page](documenting.html).

### Working with randomness

It was said previously that the execution of operators must be perfectly deterministic.
But some operators need to perform random operators, such as sampling or adding noise.
Of course this is possible with Accio, if you respect some simple rules.

First, you need to declare your operator as *unstable*.
It means that its implementation perform random operations.
To do that, you must override the `isUnstable` method, that receives the inputs of the operator (before it is executed) and must decide whether it is unstable.
It means that you can mark an operator as unstable depending on its actual inputs.

The **only** source of randomness that you can use now is the one provided by the `OpContext.seed` field.
This field contains a long that can be used in `scala.util.Random` and other sources of randomness as a seed.
This seed has been initialized either randomly, or from the master seed that has been specified when launching the experiment.
It allows to reproduce experiments by using the exact same source of randomness.
Other sources of randomness, such as system time, should still be banished in order to allow reproducibility of results.
Be careful to keep your `isUnstable` implementation consistent with your `execute` implementation.
Operators not declared as unstable will not have access to this seed and an exception will be raised.

```scala
import fr.cnrs.liris.accio.core.api._
import scala.util.Random

@Op(
  category = "numeric",
  help = "An operator that multiplies a number by another one and optionally adds a number")
class MultiplyOp extends Operator[MultiplyIn, MultiplyOut] {
  override def execute(in: MultiplyIn, ctx: OpContext): MultiplyOut = {
    val plus = if (in.add) {
      val rnd = new Random(ctx.seed)
      rnd.nextDouble()
    } else 0d
    MultiplyOut(in.a * in.b + plus)
  }
  
  override def isUnstable(in: MultiplyIn): Boolean = in.add  
}

case class MultiplyIn(@Arg a: Int, @Arg b: Int, @Arg add: Boolean)

case class MultiplyOut(@Arg c: Int)
```
