Accio: A location privacy framework
===================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/privamov/accio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/privamov/accio)

Accio is a research oriented-tool, usually developed internally at the [LIRIS laboratory](https://liris.cnrs.fr/) to generate results for paper.
It is now open in the hope it can benefit others.
At its heart, Accio is a workflow management software whose goal is to schedule and execute operations, and then collect and anlyse their results.
Since the beginning, it was designed towards work on spatio-temporal data and location privacy, although it could be extended for other purposes.
It is already used by several persons across several research teams.
